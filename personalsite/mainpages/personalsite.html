        <h2>Password protection</h2>
        <p>
            This concept refers to the importance of using strong passwords to protect our online accounts. A strong password should be unique, have a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, and should not be easily guessable. It is also recommended not to share passwords with anyone and to regularly change them to maintain the security of our accounts.

        <h2>Phishing awareness</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing is a technique used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals and obtain sensitive information, such as passwords or banking data. The concept of phishing awareness involves being vigilant and able to identify possible phishing attempts. This includes not clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages, not providing sensitive personal information through unverified links, and being attentive to warning signs, such as spelling errors or unusual requests.

            <p>
                Ransomware is a bad program that locks your important files and asks for money to unlock them. Be careful with emails and downloads, and backup your files to avoid this problem. Ask for help if you're not sure about something.

            <h3>Malware</h3>
            <p>
                Malware, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware, is used to infect people's devices. Hackers distribute malware through malicious email attachments, infected software downloads, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications. Once installed, malware can damage the system, steal information, or allow remote access to the device.

                Tricky people online pretend to be nice and try to get important information from us. Never share passwords or click on suspicious links. Ask a trusted adult for help if something doesn't feel right. They can guide you and keep you safe online. Remember, your safety is important!
